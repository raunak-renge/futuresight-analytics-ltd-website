                <h3>Financial Services Data Consolidation</h3>
                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>A European financial firm was struggling with fragmented reporting systems across multiple business units. Data inconsistencies led to conflicting reports, and manual consolidation consumed weeks of analyst time each quarter.</p>
                <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                <p>We designed and built a unified Snowflake-based data warehouse, consolidating data from 12 source systems. We implemented automated ETL pipelines with robust data quality checks and created a suite of Tableau dashboards for executive and operational reporting.</p>
                <div class="case-results">
                    <h5>Results</h5>
                    <ul>

                <h3>Global ETL Modernisation</h3>
                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>A multinational corporation needed to modernise their legacy on-premises ETL infrastructure. Their existing batch processes were slow, difficult to maintain, and couldn't support real-time reporting requirements.</p>
                <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                <p>We migrated critical ETL workflows to Informatica IICS in the cloud, implementing Change Data Capture (CDC) for incremental loads. We optimised data transformation logic and introduced automated monitoring and alerting.</p>
                <div class="case-results">

                <p>A media company wanted to improve user experience by automatically analysing audio-visual content to generate metadata and recommendations. Their manual tagging process was labour-intensive and inconsistent.</p>
                <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                <p>Leveraging our research expertise in multimodal AI, we built machine learning models that analyse both audio and visual features of content. The models automatically classify content, detect key moments, and power personalised recommendations.</p>
                <div class="case-results">
